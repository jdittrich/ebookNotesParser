# ebookNotesParser

Webapp to show the notes from your ebook-reader.  Currently only works with Tolino/Rakuten format. 

Use: 

* "Upload" a file with notes.
* See the notes as a table
* if you want to copy your notes somewhere, e.g. a literature management app, it might be useful to only copy content and page number – which is turned on and off by the checkbox on top.
* If you want to display another file: Scroll at the very bottom of the table with the notes – the upload form is still there and will flush the old table and show the new content. You can also just reload. 

The "Upload" never uploads anything to a sever, it only makes the file accessible to the locally running script that parses and shows the file.
